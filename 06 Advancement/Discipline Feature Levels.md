Discipline features define much of a Seeker’s power and playstyle.

Features occur at fixed levels:

- Level 1: Core identity features  
- Level 3: Choice of specialization options  
- Level 5: Mid-tier Discipline power  
- Level 8: Final Discipline specialization choices  

All Disciplines follow this structure based on the entries in Character Creation & Development. These features do not change unless the Discipline itself is rewritten.
