Seekers level up through story milestones instead of XP. When a Seeker gains a level, they advance their core statistics and Discipline features based on the progression outlined in Character Creation & Development.

Leveling grants:
- increased HP
- Attribute increases at specified levels
- Discipline features at levels 1, 3, 5, and 8
- expanded Relic Slots at milestone levels determined by the Discipline or narrative triggers

Advancement is designed to be simple, predictable, and tied to story pacing rather than numerical reward loops.
