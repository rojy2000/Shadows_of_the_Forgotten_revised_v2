At Level 1, characters begin with:
- HP: 10 + FIT
- AC: 10 + DEX + Armor

At each new level, a Seeker gains:
- +5 HP + FIT

These increases occur automatically and do not require rolls. HP progression ensures steady survivability while keeping combat lethal and tactical.

Armor and AC do not automatically increase with level. They improve only when a character gains access to better equipment, relic effects, or temporary bonuses.
