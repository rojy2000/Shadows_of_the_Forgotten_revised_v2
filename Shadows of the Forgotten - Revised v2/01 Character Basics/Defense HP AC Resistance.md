A Seeker’s defensive statistics determine how well they survive the dangers of the dungeon.

These mechanics originate from the Core Rules (Part II) and Character Creation (Part IV).

## Health Points (HP)

A character’s maximum HP is determined by their Discipline.

When a character reaches **0 HP**, they become **Unconscious**.  
They do not become Dying unless they take further harm.

---

## Armor Class (AC)

AC measures how hard a character is to hit.

**AC = 10 + DEX + Armor Bonus**

Armor Bonuses:
- Light Armor: +1
- Medium Armor: +2
- Heavy Armor: +3 (Frontline only)
- Shield: +1 (Frontline only)

Environmental hazards may temporarily raise or lower AC.

## Resistance

Resistance reduces incoming damage by a flat amount.

Example:
> Resistance 2 → reduce all incoming damage by 2.

Some relics, hazards, or conditions may grant or reduce Resistance.
