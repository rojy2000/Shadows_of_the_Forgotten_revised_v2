Relics are ancient, mysterious devices recovered from the depths of the dungeon.  
They can project force, shield allies, unleash elemental bursts, manipulate the environment, or reveal hidden truths.

Although their origins are obscured by time, Seekers treat relics as tools, divine gifts, or arcane mechanisms.

This is only a high-level overview.  
Full relic mechanics appear later in Section **05_Relics**.
