## Synchronization
Synchronization represents resonance between a Seeker and a relic category.

Each Discipline grants:

A Seeker may only attune relics matching their Synchronization types.

## Relic Slots
Relic Slots determine how many relics a character may attune at once.

Seekers begin with:
- 2 Relic Slots  

Slots increase through:
- leveling  
- milestones  
- special story triggers
