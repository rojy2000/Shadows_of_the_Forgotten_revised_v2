Relics are mysterious objects recovered from the depths of the dungeon. Their forms range from small hand-held artifacts to large structures embedded in the environment.

Instead of traditional magic, relics harness lost forces, forgotten systems, or resonant patterns that Seekers can tap into.

To most people, relics are miracles.  
To Seekers, they are essential survival tools.

Relics can:
- project force  
- create barriers  
- disrupt threats  
- reveal hidden information  
- manipulate the battlefield  

Relics require **attunement**, **activation**, and sometimes impose **strain** when overused.
