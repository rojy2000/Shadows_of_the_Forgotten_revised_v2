Combat takes place using an abstract gridless formation based on two rows:

- **Frontline**  
- **Backline**

This system preserves tactical clarity while minimizing measurement overhead.

## Frontline

The Frontline:
- Must contain at least one Seeker (if possible)  
- Receives all melee attacks  
- Provides +1 melee damage to allies in this row  
- Protects the Backline from melee threats  

---

## Backline

The Backline:
- Is protected from melee attacks while the Frontline is active  
- Suffers fewer attacks  
- Ranged and support combatants often operate here  
- Ranged attacks from enemies take –2 to hit Backline targets

## Formation Integrity

If the Frontline collapses, enemies may break through.  
See **Broken Formation** for full rules.
