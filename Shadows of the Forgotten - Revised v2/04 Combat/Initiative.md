Initiative determines the initial tempo of an encounter.

---

## Rolling Initiative

Each Seeker rolls:
**1d20 + DEX**

Enemies roll once for their group using their highest Dexterity.

---

## Ongoing Order

After Surprise is resolved (if any), Seekers always choose their turn order each round.

Enemies always act after Seekers, unless a rule explicitly overrides this.
