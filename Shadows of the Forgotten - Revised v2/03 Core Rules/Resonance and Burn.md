## **Resonance, Burn, and Backlash**

Resonance represents the inner pressure, instinct, and force of will that builds within a Seeker when they push beyond normal limits. Whether interpreted as spiritual power, emotional intensity, or something deeper, Resonance is a personal resource that fuels decisive, tide-turning actions in combat.

Resonance accumulates slowly, and releasing it through a **Burn** carries both great power and meaningful risk.

---

### **Resonance Level & Capacity**

Each character tracks two values:

- **Resonance Level** — your *current* stored Resonance  
- **Resonance Capacity** — the *maximum* you can store (always **5**)  

Your Resonance Level always starts at **0** and resets to **0** immediately after a Burn.

---

### **Building Resonance**

Seekers may consciously gather power and focus through discipline, intuition, or emotional clarity.

> **Build Resonance — 2 Actions**  
> Increase your **Resonance Level by +1**, to a maximum of **5**.

You cannot Burn if your Resonance Level is **0**.

Building Resonance is deliberate, time-consuming, and risky when enemies are closing in.

---

### **Burning Resonance**

A **Burn** is the explosive release of everything you’ve stored.  
Every Burn unleashes a powerful surge based on your **Primary Role**.

> **Burn — 2 Actions**  
> Release ALL stored Resonance.  
> Apply your Burn Effect.  
> Immediately make a **Backlash roll**.  
> Set Resonance Level to **0**.

Burn effects remain active until the **end of your next turn**.

Burn is always dramatic and can rapidly swing the momentum of a fight.

---

## **Burn Effects by Primary Role**

Each Discipline falls under one of four primary combat roles.  
When you Burn, use the effect listed for your role.

---

### **Frontline — Bulwark Surge**

Your stance hardens and your presence shields your allies.

You gain:

- **+1 AC per Resonance burned**  
- **+1 Resistance per Resonance burned**

*Example:* Burning 3 Resonance grants **+3 AC** and **Resistance 3** until end of your next turn.

---

### **Striker — Execution Surge**

Your focus sharpens into lethal precision.

As part of the Burn action, make one weapon attack that gains:

- **+Resonance to hit**
- **+Resonance × 2 bonus damage**

This attack is included inside the Burn action; it does not cost extra Actions.

---

### **Controller — Disruption Surge**

Your presence destabilizes enemy momentum.

Choose a number of enemies up to the Resonance you burned.  
Each chosen enemy suffers until end of your next turn:

- **–Resonance to attack rolls**  
- **–Resonance to all saving throws**

---

### **Support — Restoration Surge**

A stabilizing wave flows from you, steadying the party.

Allies in your row:

- regain **HP equal to the Resonance burned**, and  
- gain **+Resonance to their next roll** made before end of your next turn.

---

## **Backlash**

Burning power is never fully safe.

After resolving your Burn effect, roll:

> **1d20 — if the result is ≤ Resonance burned, Backlash occurs.**

If the roll is higher, nothing bad happens.

---

### **Backlash Severity**

| **Resonance Burned** | **Condition Applied**          |
|----------------------|--------------------------------|
| 1                    | **Disoriented**                |
| 2                    | **Entangled**                  |
| 3                    | **Stunned**                    |
| 4                    | **Blinded**                    |
| 5                    | **Unconscious (1 round)**      |

#### **Unconscious (1 round)**
A special case of the Unconscious condition — you recover automatically at the start of your next turn unless damaged.

---

## **Player Summary**

1. **Spend 2 Actions** → Build Resonance (+1)  
2. **Spend 2 Actions** → Burn (release all Resonance)  
3. Apply your **role’s Burn Effect**  
4. **Roll Backlash** (d20 vs Resonance burned)  
5. Set Resonance Level to **0**

Burns are powerful, risky, and dramatically shape combat pacing.
