The Difficulty Class represents how challenging a task is.

| Task Difficulty | DC |
|-----------------|----|
| Easy | 10 |
| Standard | 12 |
| Hard | 15 |
| Severe | 18 |
| Extreme | 20–24 |

Extreme tasks represent overwhelming danger or near-impossible challenges.

The GM may adjust DC based on:
- environmental factors  
- player creativity  
- relic interactions  
- advantage or hindrance created by circumstances
