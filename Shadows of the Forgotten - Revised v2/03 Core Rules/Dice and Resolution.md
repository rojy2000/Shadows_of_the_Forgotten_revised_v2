_Shows of the Forgotten_ uses a single, unified mechanic for resolving uncertain outcomes.

To attempt an action:

**Roll 1d20 + Attribute + modifiers**, and compare the total against a **Difficulty Class (DC)**.

If your roll meets or exceeds the DC, you succeed.

This mechanic is used for:
- attacking  
- activating relics  
- dodging hazards  
- deciphering glyphs  
- navigating environments  
- social insights and perception  

The GM determines the DC based on the situation.
