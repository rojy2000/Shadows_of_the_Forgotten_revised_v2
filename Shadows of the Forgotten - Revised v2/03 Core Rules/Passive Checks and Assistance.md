## Passive Checks

Sometimes the GM uses a passive value when a roll isn’t appropriate.

**Passive Score = 10 + Attribute**

Used for:
- ambient perception  
- noticing subtle glyphs  
- background environmental awareness

## Assistance

When a character helps another:

- One character rolls.
- **One** helper adds **+1** to the roll.

Only one helper may contribute.
