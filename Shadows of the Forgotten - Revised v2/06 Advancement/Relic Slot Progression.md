Seekers begin with:
- 2 Relic Slots

Additional Relic Slots are gained through:
- specific level milestones listed in Discipline progressions  
- narrative or story-based milestones determined by GM judgment  
- relic interactions or glyph revelations when specified

Slot growth is intentionally limited to preserve the rarity and weight of relic choice. Attunement decisions remain meaningful throughout play.
