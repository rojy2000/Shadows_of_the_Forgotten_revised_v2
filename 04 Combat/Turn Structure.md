Combat proceeds in rounds.  
Each round follows a predictable sequence that maintains speed and tactical clarity.

---

## Determine Turn Order

Characters act in any order the party chooses.  
Enemies act by group, in fixed order.

Seekers always take their turns before enemies unless a **Surprise Round** occurs.

---

## Seeker Turns

Seekers choose the order in which they act.  
This allows coordination of abilities, relics, and tactics.

---

## Enemy Turns

Enemies act as groups.  
Each group shares a single turn.

---

## Reactions

A character may use **one Reaction per round** when triggered.

If multiple effects resolve at once, the original Initiative rolls determine priority.
