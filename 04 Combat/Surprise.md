At the start of combat, the GM determines whether the Seekers or the enemy is Surprised.

A Surprise Round occurs if the Seekers fail to anticipate danger.

## Effects of Surprise

If Seekers are Surprised:
- Enemies take a full round of actions before the Seekers may act.

If enemies are Surprised:
- Seekers take a full round before enemies may react.

After Surprise is resolved, combat proceeds normally.
