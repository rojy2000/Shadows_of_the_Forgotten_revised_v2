Most attacks follow the standard resolution:

**Roll 1d20 + Attribute**, succeed if the result meets the target’s **AC**.

## Attack Types

**Melee (Heavy weapons):** Fitness  
**Melee (Finesse weapons):** Dexterity  
**Ranged:** Dexterity

## Damage

| Weapon Type | Damage |
|-------------|---------|
| Light | 1d6 |
| Martial | 1d8 |
| Heavy | 1d10 |
| Improvised | 1d4 |

Damage = weapon die + relevant Attribute.

## Critical Hits

A roll of **20+** deals **double weapon dice**.
