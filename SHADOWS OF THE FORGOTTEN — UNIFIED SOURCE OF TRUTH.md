### _System Reference & Mechanical Canon_

This SToT defines:

1. **Core Resolution System**
    
2. **Attributes, Attacks, Defense**
    
3. **Actions & Turn Structure**
    
4. **Formation & Targeting**
    
5. **Aid, Healing, Conditions, Dying**
    
6. **Relic Activation, Strain, Synchronization**
    
7. **Resonance, Burn, Backlash**
    

Where contradictions existed between documents, this SToT provides the **final version**.

# **1. Resolution Framework**

## **1.1 Attribute Test**

> **1d20 + Attribute**

Used for:

- environmental tasks
    
- saves
    
- social/perception
    
- deciphering glyphs
    
- ranged and melee attacks (via weapon tag)
    

## **Difficulty Numbers (DN)**

|Difficulty|DN|
|---|---|
|Easy|10|
|Standard|12|
|Hard|15|
|Severe|18|
|Extreme|20–24|

Relics **do not use DN**. They use the Relic Activation Table (Section 6).

---

# **2. Attributes**

- **FIT** — force, endurance, frontline durability
    
- **DEX** — speed, agility, finesse
    
- **WIS** — perception, intuition, emotional insight
    
- **INT** — logic, analysis, glyphcraft
    

Attributes range from **–1 to +4** in normal play.

---

# **3. Combat Turn Structure**

### **3.1 Each Round**

1. Determine Surprise
    
2. Seekers act first (any order they choose)
    
3. Enemy groups act in their initiative order
    

### **3.2 On Your Turn**

You receive:

- **2 Actions**
    
- **1 Reaction** per round (off-turn)
    

### **3.3 Core Actions**

- Attack
    
- Activate a relic
    
- Switch rows
    
- Aid
    
- Defend
    
- Build Resonance
    
- Use Item
    
- Discipline Feature
    
- Environment Interaction
    

### **3.4 Reactions (Examples)**

- Guard Ally: –1 damage to ally in same row
    
- Snap Shot: ranged attack when opening appears
    
- Counterstep: avoid forced movement
    

---

# **4. Combat Targeting & Formation**

## **4.1 Two-Row System**

- **Frontline**
    
- **Backline**
    

### **Frontline**

- Must contain ≥ 1 conscious character
    
- Absorbs **all enemy melee attacks**
    
- Allies in Frontline get **+1 melee damage**
    

### **Backline**

- Enemy ranged attacks vs Backline: **–2**
    
- Cannot be targeted by melee unless formation breaks
    

---

## **4.2 Switching Rows**

> **Costs 1 Action**

You cannot switch if:

- Entangled
    
- Unconscious
    
- Dying
    

---

## **4.3 Broken Formation**

Formation breaks if Frontline becomes:

- empty
    
- all members unconscious or dying
    
- forcibly displaced (forced movement effect)
    

**Stunned NO LONGER breaks formation.**  
(This resolves the inconsistency.)

### When formation breaks:

- Enemies gain **+1 to all attacks** for 1 round
    
- Enemy melee may target **either row**
    
- Ranged ignores Backline penalty
    

---

# **5. Attacks, Defense, & Damage**

## **5.1 Attack Rolls**

> **1d20 + Attribute**

Attribute depends on weapon:

- **Heavy** → FIT
    
- **Finesse** → DEX
    
- **Ranged** → DEX
    

## **5.2 Damage**

> **Weapon Die + same Attribute**

Weapon Dice:

- Light: 1d6
    
- Martial: 1d8
    
- Heavy: 1d10
    
- Improvised: 1d4
    

Critical Hit: **double weapon dice**  
Natural 1: **not auto-fail** unless GM rules otherwise.

---

## **5.3 Defense**

### **Armor Class (AC)**

> **10 + DEX + Armor Bonus**

- Light +1
    
- Medium +2
    
- Heavy +3 (Frontline only)
    
- Shield +1 (Frontline only)
    

### **Resistance**

Flat damage reduction to every hit.

---

# **6. Aid, Healing, Conditions, Dying**

## **6.1 Aid (Unified Rule)**

> **Aid (Restore 1 HP) — 2 Actions — Usable ONLY on Unconscious allies**

This resolves all contradictions.

### Modifiers:

- **Twilight Healer**: +1 HP
    
- **Preserver Steady Hands**: +1 HP
    
- **Swift Aid**: reduces action cost to **1 Action**
    

Healing stacks additively.

---

## **6.2 HP & Collapse**

- 0 HP → **Unconscious**
    
- Taking damage while Unconscious → **Dying**
    

## **6.3 Reviving a Dying Character**

Only possible via:

- relic that restores HP
    
- healing feature that restores HP
    

Aid **does NOT** revive Dying.

---

## **6.4 Conditions (Canonical)**

Conditions include:

- Entangled
    
- Disoriented
    
- Stunned
    
- Poisoned
    
- Bleeding
    
- Blinded
    
- Wounded
    
- Unconscious
    
- Dying
    

All durations and effects are as written in the vault.

### Special Case Condition (for Backlash):

**Unconscious (1 round)**

> Treat as Unconscious, but automatically ends at the start of the user’s next turn unless damaged.

---

# **7. Relics — Activation, Strain, Synchronization**

## **7.1 Relic Activation**

Relics use a **4-tier roll table**, not DN.

> **1d20 + Attribute (+3 if Synchronized)**

|Roll|Effect|
|---|---|
|**20+**|Critical Success (enhanced)|
|**12–19**|Success|
|**6–11**|Partial|
|**1–5**|Critical Failure → Strain|

---

## **7.2 Relic Strain**

On Critical Failure, roll 1d6 for strain effect:

Includes:

- damage
    
- minor conditions
    
- lockout of relic
    
- arc damage to allies
    

Strain and Backlash are separate systems.

---

## **7.3 Synchronization**

- 2 at level 1
    
- Provided by Discipline
    
- Grants **+3** to Activation Rolls
    
- Matches relic type (Combat, Utility, Glyph, Support)
    

Synchronization enhances mastery but never restricts use.

---

# **8. Resonance, Burn, Backlash (Unified)**

## **8.1 Resonance**

You may **Build Resonance**:

> **Build Resonance — 2 Actions → +1 Resonance Level**

Resonance max: **5**.  
You cannot Burn if Resonance = 0.

---

## **8.2 Burn**

> **Burn — 2 Actions → Release ALL Resonance**

Resets Resonance to 0.

Burn effects depend on Primary Role:

### **Frontline — Bulwark Surge**

+Resonance AC  
+Resonance Resistance

### **Striker — Execution Surge**

Immediately make one weapon attack:  
+Resonance to hit  
+Resonance × 2 damage

### **Controller — Disruption Surge**

Choose up to Resonance enemies:  
–Resonance attack rolls  
–Resonance saves

### **Support — Restoration Surge**

Allies in your row regain **HP = Resonance**,  
and gain **+Resonance to their next roll**.

---

## **8.3 Backlash (Unified Rule)**

After Burn:

> Roll 1d20  
> If result ≤ Resonance burned → suffer Backlash

Backlash Table:

|Resonance|Backlash Condition|
|---|---|
|1|Disoriented|
|2|Entangled|
|3|Stunned|
|4|Blinded|
|5|Unconscious (1 round)|

---

# ⭐ **Unifying Notes (Fixing All Conflicts)**

This SToT explicitly solves:

### ✔ Aid contradictions

Aid is now _only_ usable on Unconscious targets; Action cost is unified.

### ✔ Stunned no longer breaks formation

Resolves inconsistency between Stunned severity and Formation rules.

### ✔ Relics do not use DN

Fully separates the two resolution systems.

### ✔ Temporary Unconscious added as a special condition

Fixes Backlash mismatch.

### ✔ Preserver revival clarified re: Dying

Their features stop collapse to 0 HP, but do not affect Dying.

### ✔ Forced movement clarified

Only forced movement breaks formation; Stunned does not.

### ✔ Resonance/Burn action economy unified

Both cost 2 Actions always.
