## Introduction

Welcome to *Shadows of the Forgotten*, a ruleset built for fast, tense, atmospheric dungeon adventures.  
In this game, you and your fellow Seekers descend into ancient depths where danger, mystery, and forgotten power weave together. Every choice matters. Every step takes you closer to the truth. The darkness does not wait, once you enter, you must rely on your wits, your allies, and the strange relics you uncover.

This handbook contains all the rules players need to create Seekers, understand how the world functions, and navigate dangers both physical and supernatural. It is written to be concise, clear, and easy to reference at the table, whether you are learning the game for the first time or looking up a rule during intense moments of play.

The deeper lore of the dungeon, its history, and its secrets belong to the Game Master. This book focuses entirely on what a Seeker would know from lived experience: how to survive, how to fight, how relics behave, and what to expect as they grow stronger.

Prepare yourself, your journey begins the moment you turn the page.
