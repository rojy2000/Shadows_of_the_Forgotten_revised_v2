Characters in _Shadows of the Forgotten_ are defined by several core components:

- **Attributes** (FIT, DEX, WIS, INT)  
- **Background** (narrative identity + mechanical bonus)  
- **Discipline** (playstyle archetype similar to a soft “class”)  
- **Relic Synchronization** (which relic types can be attuned)  
- **Health, Defense, and Inventory**

---

## Background

Your Background reflects your life before descending into the dungeon.  
It provides a narrative hook and a small mechanical perk.

Backgrounds appear in **02_Character_Creation/Backgrounds.md**.

---

## Discipline

Your Discipline is your core archetype:

- Vanguard  
- Skirmisher  
- Cipher  
- Preserver  

Disciplines provide:
- HP  
- Combat style  
- Starting Synchronizations  
- Progression features (Levels 1, 3, 5, 8)

---

## Relic Synchronization

Each Discipline grants starting Synchronizations that determine what types of relics can be attuned:

- Combat  
- Utility  
- Glyph  

These grow as the Seeker advances.

---

## Formation Placement

Seekers fight in the **Frontline** or **Backline**, depending on Discipline and tactical choices.

More details appear in the **Combat** section.
