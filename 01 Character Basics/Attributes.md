Characters in _Shadows of the Forgotten_ are defined in part by four core Attributes.  

These Attributes represent broad categories of physical and mental capability.

Each Attribute modifies rolls in its domain and influences combat, relic activation, and survival.

Characters begin with the following:

- Distribute **+6 points** among FIT, DEX, WIS, INT.
