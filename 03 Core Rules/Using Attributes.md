When attempting an action with an uncertain outcome, the GM calls for an Attribute test.

You succeed if:
**Your roll meets or exceeds the DC.**

The GM chooses:
1. **Which Attribute applies**
2. **Any bonuses or penalties**
3. **The DC of the task**

Attributes never limit what characters *may attempt* — only how effective they are.
